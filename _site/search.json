    "title": "Uncertainty in xG. Part 2: Partial Pooling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR\nThis is part 2 of an article on fitting a Bayesian partial pooling model to predict expected goals. It has the benefits of (a) quantifying aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and (b) making both group-level (player-specific) and population-level (team-specific) probabilistic predictions. If you are interested in these ideas but not in statistical language, then you can also check out part 1.\n\n\n\nExpected Goals\nExpected Goals (or xG) is a metric that was developed to predict the probability of a football (soccer) player scoring a goal, conditional on some mathematical characterisation of the shooting opportunity. Since we have a binary outcome (he or she will either score or not score) we can use everyone’s favourite GLM - logistic regression.\nUnfortunately this causes some overlap with a previous blog post - ‘Bayesian Logistic Regression with Stan’, but don’t worry - the focus here is all about Partial Pooling.\nFirst let’s look at a non-Bayesian base case. StatsBomb have kindly made lots of football data freely available in their R package. The below creates a dataframe of the shots taken by Arsenal FC during the 2003-04 Premier League winning season.\n\nlibrary(StatsBombR); library(tidyverse)\n\nPrem_SB_matches &lt;- FreeMatches(Competitions = SB_comps %&gt;% \n                               dplyr::filter(competition_name == 'Premier League') %&gt;% \n                               dplyr::filter(competition_gender == 'male'))\n\nArsenal_0304_shots &lt;- StatsBombFreeEvents(MatchesDF = Prem_SB_matches, \n                                          Parallel = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  allclean() %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(type.name == 'Shot') %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(possession_team.name == 'Arsenal')\n\nUsing R’s tidymodels framework - make sure to have a look at Julia Silge’s tutorials if you are unfamiliar - we can specify and fit a logistic regression. The below compares our results (including confidence intervals) to those from StatsBomb.\nIf you are interested in creating something similar yourself, this model has standardised inputs for parameters with relatively large values (such as angles and distances) and one hot encoding of categorical inputs (such as whether or not the shot was taken with a players weaker foot).\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we have used StatsBomb data (though their model will no doubt be based on a much larger collection) we would expect our results to be similar to theirs, and they are. Considering just the point estimates, the two models appear to broadly agree, especially when both are predicting a very low or a very high xG.\nHowever, some of the confidence intervals on our tidymodels predictions are very large. Although we would generally expect these to decrease as we introduced more data, we know that football matches (and especially specific events within football matches) are full of uncertainty. If we want to be able to quantify this uncertainty in a more useful way (we do) - we want a Bayesian model. The below section details the specific type of Bayesian model that I’m proposing for estimating xG.\n\n\nMulti-Level (Partial Pooling) Models\nHierarchical (or ‘nested’) data contains multiple groups within a population, such as players with a football team. Unfortunately, this information is lost (and bias is introduced) when such data is modelled as a single population. At the other extreme we can assume each group is fully independent, and the difficulty here is that there will be less data available and therefore more variance in our predictions.\nConsequently, we want an intermediate solution, acknowledging variation between groups, but allowing for data from one group to inform predictions about others. This is achieved by using a multi-level (or hierarchical) model structure. Such models allow partial sharing (or pooling) of information between groups, to the extent that the data indicate is appropriate. This approach results in reduced variance (when compared to a set of corresponding independent models), a shift towards a population mean (known as shrinkage), and generally an improved predictive performance.\nSounds great, right? So why would anyone ever not use this kind of model? In his excellent blog, Richard McElreath makes the case that multi-level models should be our default approach. His greatest criticism of them is that they require some experience or training to specify and interpret. His book has a dedicated chapter to help with that. Of course, there are many better descriptions of multi-level modelling than you will get from me, but I personally found the examples in Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill’s book to be very helpful. Finally, Michael Betancourt has written a much more comprehensive blog post on the topic, which includes a discussion on the underlying assumption of exchangeability.\nWe can create a partial pooling model by re-writing the below:\n\\[\nxG = Inverse \\; Logit(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot X)\n\\]\nTo look like this:\n\\[\nxG = Inverse \\; Logit(\\alpha_{[Player]} + \\beta_{[Player]} \\cdot X)\n\\]\nIn this new structure, each parameter will now be a vector of length \\(N\\) (where \\(N\\) players are being considered). This means there will be a different co-efficient describing how \\(xG\\) varies with distance from goal for each player. This makes sense as we would expect variation between players and we want our model to be able to describe it.\nIf each of these parameters had their own priors, we would essentially have specified \\(N\\) independent models - one for each player. But there is a twist here: each of the vectors of co-efficients share a single prior.\n\\[\n\\beta \\sim N(\\mu_{\\beta}, \\; \\sigma_{\\beta})\n\\]\nThis will pull each of the individual co-efficients towards a shared mean, \\(\\mu_{\\beta}\\). The variation between the players (for a given parameter) is characterised by \\(\\sigma_{\\beta}\\). Rather than specify these ourselves, we will also estimate these as part of the model. This means that the extent of the pooling is conditional on the data, which is an extremely useful feature. However, we then need to include priors on these parameters, which are known as hyperpriors.\nNote that this process has introduced an extra layer (or level) to the model structure. This is why they are known as multi-level or hierarchical models. The term partial pooling is more a description of what they do.\n\n\n\nIn the Absence of Multi-Level Models\n\n\nWe see the greatest benefit of this approach when only limited data is available for one or more groups. If one player took very few shots during a period of data collection, then there will be a lot of uncertainty in their xG predictions ….unless we can make use of the data we have for the rest of the team.\n\n\nWhat does this look like in Stan?\nThe below is a reduced Stan model, with just one co-efficient (concerning the distance from goal of the shot). This is not me being secretive, its just that the full model is quite large. You can simply add more parameters like a multi-variate linear regression on the log-odds scale, but remember that they will each require priors, hyperpriors, and data.\n\ndata {\n\n  int &lt;lower = 1&gt; n_shots;\n  int &lt;lower = 0, upper = 1&gt; goal [n_shots];\n  \n  int &lt;lower = 1&gt; n_players;\n  int &lt;lower = 1&gt; player_id [n_shots];\n  \n  vector [n_shots] dist_goal;\n\n  real mu_mu_alpha;\n  real &lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma_mu_alpha;\n  real&lt;lower = 0&gt; rate_sigma_alpha;\n  \n  real mu_mu_beta_dist_goal;\n  real &lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma_mu_beta_dist_goal;\n  real&lt;lower = 0&gt; rate_sigma_beta_dist_goal;\n  \n}\n\nparameters {\n  \n  vector [n_players] alpha;\n  \n  vector [n_players] beta_dist_goal;\n\n  real mu_alpha;\n  real &lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma_alpha;\n  \n  real mu_beta_dist_goal;\n  real &lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma_beta_dist_goal;\n  \n}\n\nmodel {\n\n  // Logistic model \n  \n  goal ~ bernoulli_logit(alpha[player_id] + beta_dist_goal[player_id] .* dist_goal); \n\n  // Priors \n  \n  alpha ~ normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha);\n  beta_dist_goal ~ normal(mu_beta_dist_goal, sigma_beta_dist_goal);\n\n  // Hyperpriors\n  \n  mu_alpha ~ normal(mu_mu_alpha, sigma_mu_alpha);\n  sigma_alpha ~ exponential(rate_sigma_alpha);\n  \n  mu_beta_dist_goal ~ normal(mu_mu_beta_dist_goal, sigma_mu_beta_dist_goal);\n  sigma_beta_dist_goal ~ exponential(rate_sigma_beta_dist_goal);\n  \n}\n\ngenerated quantities {\n  \n  real alpha_pp = normal_rng(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha);\n  real beta_dist_goal_pp = normal_rng(mu_beta_dist_goal, sigma_beta_dist_goal);\n\n}\n\nA few things that I’d like to note:\n\nMy input data is of length n_shots and my parameters are vectors of length n_players.\nI’ve included my hyperpriors (the mu_mu_..., sigma_mu..., and rate_sigma... terms) as data, rather than hard code values into the file. This is so I can re-run the model with new hyperpriors without Stan needing to recompile.\nEven though I have included the mu... and sigma.. terms as priors in my comment, this is just to help describe the model structure. They are all included in the Parameters block of the model. As discussed above, they are inferred as part of the joint posterior distribution, meaning that we are estimating the extent of the pooling from the data.\nI’m using the generated quantities to produce my population-level parameters, so that I have everything I need to put together probabilistic predictions in either R or Python.\n\n#### Model Parameters\nThe posterior distribution (which Stan has sampled from) is a joint probabilistic model of all parameters. Let’s have a look at a few, specifically those corresponding to the effect of distance between the shot taker and goalkeeper. Shown below is the co-efficient for \\(6\\) players (indexed \\(1 \\rightarrow 6\\)). We can see that the distance to the keeper is predicted to influence each player differently.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the players will have taken fewer shots and therefore we will have less data to fit their player-specific parameters. The mu_beta_dist_keeper and sigma_beta_dist_keeper parameters in the above plot are the shared ‘priors’ that control how the data from each of the players can be used to inform one another. The beta_dist_keeper_pp parameter is specified in the generated quantities block of my Stan model. It is correlated samples from the distribution characterised by the shared priors. This becomes the population (team) level co-efficient in my predictions.\nI’ve included some predictions for some actual shots taken that season in part 1 of this article, but since this is the purpose of the model let’s look at one more.\nHere is Robert Pirès goal from just outside the box at home to Bolton Wanderers in 2004. It was on his stronger (right) foot and he was not under pressure from any defenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs labelled on the above plot, the StatsBomb model only gave Pirès a 5% chance of scoring this chance. The below xG predictions are from the Bayesian partial pooling model, both for Robert Pirès (upper) and for the case where any Arsenal player could be shooting (lower). Also shown is the StatsBomb prediction. We see an improvement (since we know this chance was scored) when we make a player-specific prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur probabilistic predictions contain more information than point estimates, but for the purposes of a simpler comparison we can consider the mean value. The mean value of our team-level prediction is 20%, but conditional on the knowledge that Pirès was shooting, this becomes 33%.\nIf Arsène Wenger could’ve chosen which of his players was presented with this opportunity, Robert Pirès would’ve been one of his top choices (though possible behind Thierry Henry). We have an intuitive understanding that such players have the necessary attributes to score from relatively difficult opportunities such as this, and this is accounted for in our model. We have tackled the challenge of greatly reduced (player-specific) datasets, by allowing them to share information on the basis of how similar they are.\n\n\nChallenges\nMulti-level models capture the multi-level structure of hierarchical (nested) datasets, accounting for both variability and commonality between different groups (in this example: between different players in a team). However, as we can see from the previous plot, by introducing a set of parameters for each group and relating them all in this way, the posterior distribution now has many more dimensions and is more challenging to sample from. If you are using Stan you may now see more warning messages regarding divergent transitions - a concept that José Mourinho is acting out, below. If you do run into these problems, I would recommend reviewing the guidance in the Stan manual on reparameterisation (writing your same model on a new scale, such that it is easier for the software to work with).\n\n\n\nMou’s Divergent Transitions\n\n\nFinally, I have published a paper demonstrating this modelling approach in an engineering context, which includes additional details for anyone who is interested: ‘Consistent and coherent treatment of uncertainties and dependencies in fatigue crack growth calculations using multi-level Bayesian models’.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2021,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Uncertainty in {xG.} {Part} 2},\n  date = {2021-01-07},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/xg_pt2},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2021. “Uncertainty in xG.

    "title": "Uncertainty in xG. Part 1: Overview",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR\nThe Expected Goals (xG) metric is now widely recognised as numerical measure of the quality of a goal scoring opportunity in a football (soccer) match. In this article we consider how to deal with uncertainty in predicting xG, and how each players individual abilities can be accounted for. This is part 1 of the article, which is intended to be free of stats jargon, maths and code. If you are interested in those details, you can also check out part 2.\n\n\n\nWhat are Expected Goals?\nOpta sports tell us that the Expected Goals (or xG) of a shot describe how likely it is to be scored. The cumulative xG over a game will therefore give an indication of how many goals a team would usually score, based on the chances they created.\nWhy would anyone be interested in this? Because if the xG model is any good, it can be the basis for an evidence-based style of play. If certain individuals in a team enjoy shooting from long-distance (or any other set of circumstances associated with a low xG), they may be encouraged to keep possession until a more favourable (higher xG) chance arises.\nThere is no universally accepted way of calculating xG, so there are many competing models around. In this article I will describe a statistical model that cares about who is taking the shot, but does not treat each player as a separate independent case. More on this later…\n\n\nData: Arsenal’s Invincibles (Courtesy of StatsBomb)\nOnce upon a time (in the 2003-04 season), Arsenal FC were brilliant. That squad is still referred to as the Invincibles after finishing the season without a defeat in the league, scoring the most goals and conceding the fewest. Their top scorer, Thierry Henry, finished 4th in the Ballon d’Or voting this season (having finished 2nd the season before). Unfortunately José Mourinho arrived at Chelsea the following season and Arsenal haven’t won the league since.\nI’m using Arsenal’s unbeaten league season as an example because StatsBomb have kindly made all this data freely available in their R package.\n\n\n\nThe Invincibles\n\n\nHere are their league goal scorers:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s where the goals were scored from:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows that many of these goals were scored, even though the (StatsBomb) xG was relatively low. In fact the mean xG of the shots they scored was 0.33. This isn’t necessarily a problem as we do see improbable goals. Below is Giorgian De Arrascaeta’s contender for the 2020 FIFA Puskas award. Was anyone expecting him to score this chance? Could he do it again?\n\nAn ideal xG model would correctly predict every goal without error, but the many sources of variability in the game means that this isn’t happening any time soon. A Bayesian model (such as the one I’m proposing) will include uncertainty in it’s predictions, letting us know when it can narrow down a predicted xG, and when there is a larger range of credible values based on the available information.\n\n\nWould Henry have scored it?\nAnother feature that I’ve introduced to the model is the relationship between the data from different players. I want the model to distinguish between whether a team creates an opportunity for their top scorer, or their full-back who has never scored. One is clearly preferable, and should have a higher xG to reflect this. Why would this matter? Shooting from wide positions may (on average) be unlikely to pay off, but if your team has a winger who is especially adept at it, then it may be a strategy they should pursue.\nFor instance, Giorgian De Arrascaeta may have had a higher chance of scoring that bicycle kick when you consider that he was also nominated for the 2018 FIFA Puskas award for scoring another acrobatic volley.\nThe practical issue with considering each player separately is you now have many, smaller datasets. Larger datasets contain more information allowing for model parameters to be estimated more precisely. This sometimes encourages us to throw all our data into a single population and pretend we have a larger dataset. Your software will be happy, since it won’t know the difference, but you will lose the valuable player-specific information.\nBayesian models can do even better than this though. Consider some data that was collected from Arsenal’s defensive midfielder, Gilberto Silva. He scored 3 league goals in their invincible season, but his primary duties were defensive. He had different characteristics than Thierry Henry, but there is some commonality to take advantage of here. If Gilberto Silva scores an opportunity that gives me some information about whether Thierry Henry could have scored it too. How much information? That depends on how similar they are. Unless we tell the model, it will assume we cannot learn anything about these players from the other. Both were professional footballers. Neither was a hockey player, or a tree, or a kitten - though a statistical model could not intuit this. If the data did indicate that they were in fact very different players, then the special model structure that we are using would recognise this and not share information between them to the same extent.\nIf the above concept make sense to you, then congratulations - you appreciate the utility of multi-level (partial-pooling) Bayesian models. This sharing of information is one of many reasons Bayesian methods can perform so well on small (and imperfect) datasets.\n\n\nWhat does the Model do?\nWe have a model that describes uncertainty (using probability) and makes both team-level and player-specific predictions. Here are some examples:\nHow about Dennis Bergkamp’s dinked finish when clear through on goal against Birmingham. Remember it? Me neither - here’s where the shot was taken from:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd our predicted xG is shown below, both for Dennis Bergkamp (upper) and for the case where any Arsenal player could be shooting (lower). Here is a great example of being able to make a better prediction conditional on the information of who is taking the shot. The model has identified that Bergkamp was very capable of scoring these kind of chances and was therefore able to identify a narrow range of very high xG values. However, if we were considering a generic player in the Arsenal team, there is more uncertainty in our prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about Thierry Henry’s long range goal against Man Utd? (Note that the straight arrow in the below plot does not reflect the true trajectory of his shot).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, so I wouldn’t have seen that one coming either ….but I would have given it more of a chance knowing who was shooting.\nHere is a final example - a shot from Gilberto Silva, on his stronger foot, which was saved by Neil Sullivan (who I’d completely forgotten had signed for Chelsea that season). I thought this was worth looking at because StatsBomb’s xG suggests this was a very good chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur model did not expect him to score, and also predicted that Freddie Ljungberg would have missed. Henry (unsurprisingly) is expected to have had a better chance, but interestingly, our model thinks that Arsenal’s goalscoring winger Robert Pirès would have been most likely to score this opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thought: Making Sense of Probabilistic Predictions\n\n\n\nThoughtful Pirlo\n\n\nWhat should we make of the above predictions? The single values (point estimates) provided by analytics companies may be a bit easier to read, but I’m suggesting that they are not as useful. We should want our models to tell us when they are not sure. There is more information in a probabilistic prediction than a point estimate, which means you can go from the former to the latter, but not vice-versa. The type of model we have discussed in this article has the added benefit of sharing information between different players in a mathematically coherent way (see part 2) for the technical details).\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2020,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Uncertainty in {xG.} {Part} 1},\n  date = {2020-12-10},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/xg_pt1},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2020. “Uncertainty in xG.

    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR\nThis post is intended to be a high-level discussion of the merits and challenges of applied Bayesian statistics. It is intended to help the reader answer: Is it worth me learning Bayesian statistics? or Should I look into using Bayesian statistics in my project? No maths or code in this post.\n\n\nBayes\n\n\n\nBayes\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nFirstly, Bayesian…\n\nStatistics\nInference\nModelling\nUpdating\nData Analysis\n\n…can boradly be considered the same thing (certainly for the purposes of this post): the application of Bayes theorem to quantify uncertainty.\nDepending on your background, you may have preconceptions about Bayesian methods being specialist or complicated. However, analysts and researchers in many domains are increasingly experimenting with the growing catalogue of open source software and resources that is making probabilistic programming more accessible.\n\n\nWhat does a Bayesian approach provide?\nBayesian statistics is not the only way to account for uncertainty in calculations. The below points describe what a Bayesian approach offers, that others don’t. Note that I am only really discussing methods involving probability here, though alternative approaches are available.\n\nIntuitive Interpretation of Results\nBayesian methods give you distributions. Your parameters (and so also your predictions) are all described as distributions. A single, joint distribution in fact, which is aligned with the evidence that you provide your model. This allows you to propagate all the uncertainties and inter-dependencies when making predictions for some new input data. By comparison, alternative (frequentist) methods typically describes uncertainty in predictions using confidence intervals, which are widely used but easy to misinterpret.\nConfidence intervals are calculated so that they will contain the true value of whatever you are trying to predict with some desired frequency. They provide no information (in the absence of additional assumptions) on how credible various possible results are. The Bayesian equivalent (sometimes called credible intervals) can be drawn anywhere on a predictive distribution. In Pratt, Raiffa and Schlaiffer’s textbook an example is used to highlight this difference:\nImagine the plight of the manager who exclaims, ‘I understand [does he?] the meaning that the demand for XYZ will lie in the interval 973 to 1374 with confidence .90. However, I am particularly interested in the interval 1300 to 1500. What confidence can I place on that interval?’ Unfortunately, this question cannot be answered. Of course, however, it is possible to give a posterior probability to that particular interval - or any other - based on the sample data and on a codification of the manager’s prior judgements.\nThis is a nice example (aside from assuming the manager is a male) of a simple question that we need a Bayesian posterior distribution to answer. A more succinct description of the same view from Dan Ovando’s fishery statistics blog:\nBayesian credible intervals mean what we’d like Frequentist confidence intervals to mean.\n\n\nSeamless Integration with Decision Analysis\nFollowing on from the previous point, an analysis that directly describes the probability of any outcome is fully compatible with a decision analysis. After completing a Bayesian analysis, identifying the optimal strategy implied by your model becomes simpler and more understandable.\nAs stated in James Berger’s (quite theoretical) book on Bayesian statistics:\nBayesian analysis and decision theory go rather naturally together, partly because of their common goal of utilizing non-experimental sources of information, and partly because of deep theoretical ties.\n\n\nFlexible Modelling\nSo this one is based on a point made in Ben Lambert’s book on Bayesian statistics. It is regarding how modern Bayesian statistics is achieved in practice. The computational methods may require some effort to pick up, especially if you do not have experience with programming (though Ben’s book gives a nice introduction to Stan). However, they can be readily extended to larger and more complex models.\nEssentially, we can propose weird and bespoke model structures, and then use the same approach to fit them.\n\n\n\nSome Compelling Arguments\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges & Difficulties\nSo why would anyone ever not use Bayesian models when making predictions?\n\nSubjectivity\nPerhaps the most common criticism of Bayesian statistics is the requirement for priors - i.e. a starting point for your model. This initial estimate of uncertainty is a term in Bayes’ theorem - but how can you estimate the extent of variability before you see it in your data? This will surely be completely subjective, so the results will vary depending on who is doing the analysis. This, understandably, doesn’t seem right with a lot of casual enquirers.\nA common response to this accusation is that subjectivity is not an exclusive feature of Bayesian analysis (how about the whole approach you are taking to solving your problem !) …but at least Bayesians are required to be explicit about it. Priors mean that any subjective inputs have no-where to hide (in the code or the reporting) and so they are open to criticism. This point is discussed in much more detail in this paper from Colombia University.\nPriors can contain, as much or as little, information as desired. However, even in instances where you may feel you don’t have any upfront knowledge of a problem, they represent a valuable opportunity for introducing regularisation (which protects against bad predictions due to overfitting). This idea is discussed in detail in Richard McElreath’s textbook. I would suggest that in plenty of cases, we often have a fair idea of what is happening even before we collect and analyse data, and starting from zero everytime is just not sensible. Will a doctor who has just evaluated you base their diagnosis entirely on a test outcome, or will they incorporate that eveidence into their existing understanding of your circumstances and symptoms? Bayesian statistics is the means by which this can be done mathematically.\n\n\nComputational Requirements\nIn practice, statisticians estimate Bayesian posterior distributions using very clever Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms, that are run by their favourite probabilistic programming software. The models that I have worked with during my PhD have taken several hours to finish sampling from, but I have met statisticians whose models run for days or even weeks. Following this, there are checks that need to be completed as there are plenty of things that can go wrong with MCMC. There is a nice discussion of a recommended Bayesian workflow to make sure you are checking what you need to here.\nMy background is in mechanical and civil engineering. In discussions with engineering researchers at conferences I have often been told that the errors and complications they encountered when playing around with Bayesian software caused them to abandon the approach in favour of more established, less informative analysis. These are challenges that I imagine everyone who has attempted modern Bayesian statistics will have encountered and resolving them can require a deep understanding of your model, and perhaps some formal training. In addition some programming tricks like reparameterisation (describing your model in a seemingly equivalent way, but one that is much friendlier to your software) can also help.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nRegardless of whether you believe we exist in a deterministic universe or not, you will never have perfect state of knowledge describing your problem: uncertainty exists, so we need a sensible and safe way of accounting for it. It’s difficult to escape the implications of the Maths - for instance, in avoiding quantifying uncertainty, we are often making some implicit assumptions (the implications of which can be difficult to justify) that we may not want to propagate into our decision-making. There is generally a trade-off for apparent conveniences.\nI believe that Bayesian statistics is actually well suited to traditional engineering problems, which are concerned with managing risk when confronted with small, messy datasets and models with plenty of uncertainty. As suggested in the earlier description of confidence intervals, frequentist statistics defines probability based on occurrences of events following a large number of trials or samples. When trying to understand the behaviour of small datasets (or even unique structural systems), Bayesian statistics can shine by comparison.\nVery large datasets may contain enough information to precisely estimate parameters in a model using conventional machine learning methods, and so it becomes less worthwhile running simulations to characterise variability. But how common are these big data problems in science and engineering? Sometimes large populations of data are better described as multiple smaller constituent groups, after accounting for key differences between them. Bayesian statistics has a very useful way of managing such problems by structuring models hierarchically. This method allows for partial pooling of information between groups, so that predictions account for the variability and commonality between groups. I will provide a detailed example of this in a future post.\nBayesian inference requires (computational and personal) effort to apply. But it provides results that are generally more interpretable and closely related to the actual questions we want to answer. Whether or not these methods are worth learning will of course depend on personal circumstances. I encountered this field during my PhD, and so had plenty of time to read and play with them, which I appreicate is a privelidged position to be in.\n\n\n\nBoring, isn’t it? Writing, Fitting and Evaluating Bayesian Models All Day….\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2020,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Why Be {Bayesian?}},\n  date = {2020-03-24},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/Why_Bayes},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2020. “Why Be Bayesian?” March 24,\n2020. https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/Why_Bayes."

    "title": "Player form. Part 1: Overview",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR\nWhen is a player in form (over performing, or enjoying a hot streak) and how long does this last? If there is such an effect, I suspect it will be a result of some complicated system of personal circumstances. In this post I suggest a popular statistical model (Gaussian process) for approximating the dependencies (how many games back should we look?) and non-linearities (rise and fall of form) that we need. Again, I am suggesting that we should care about uncertainty when trying to model just about anything in football, and using probability is a helpful way of doing so.\nEllen White’s data from the 2019-20 WSL season (courtesy of StatsBomb) is used as an example.\nSimilarly to the posts on multi-level models, this will also be split into 2 parts. Part 1 (here) will focus on the features of a Gaussian process that are well suited to approximating player form. Part 2 (in preparation) will include more technical details and more code.\n\n\n\nA (Questionable) Measure of Player Form\nAs I alluded to in the TLDR above, I suspect a players form is somehow linked to their current mental state. When they are feeling confident they may be less likely to doubt their abilities, and more decisive. This could mean they act quicker and become more difficult to play against.\n\n\n\nConfidence is key …probably\n\n\nI will not propose a detailed causal model here, just a statistical proxy. But, I will be assuming that form can rise and decay over time. For some players even a single good or bad performance may be enough to drastically impact their next game, and for others this process may be smoother and less volatile. More on this later.\nFor the purposes of this post, goalscoring form on a given match day, \\(i\\), is defined as the difference between the number of goals that were scored on that match day, minus the expected number of goals, \\(xG\\) associated with the opportunities in that game.\n\\[\nForm_{[i]} = Goals_{[i]} - xG_{[i]}\n\\]\nA nice feature of this is that, in principle, it is invariant to the quality of opposition. A striker may have a higher xG when performing against a weaker team, but will therefore need to score more goals in such a game to be considered in the same form. By the same token, it should also account for the fact that a player will generally get fewer scoring opportunities as a substitute.\n…As for the not so nice features, there are plenty! For instance, what good is a measure of form that only considers goals scored? Is xG not also conditional on how well a striker is paying? Would it be more useful to standardise the result?\nThese are all fair questions, and with a little thought could all be integrated into a more comprehensive characterisation. However, the type of model that I will introduce will be equally compatible with alternative definitions, so let’s imagine we just care about whether a striker is scoring as many goals as they should be, and whether this will continue.\n\n\nEllen White\nEllen White is a clinical striker who, at the time of writing this, plays for Manchester City and England. She is a former winner of the Women’s Super League (WSL) golden boot, and is England’s all-time top scorer. So plenty of opportunities to see her distinctive celebration:\n\n\n\nEllen’s goal goggles\n\n\nStatsBomb have kindly made data from the WSL (2019/20 season) freely available in their R package, and so we will consider this league season of Ellen White’s career here.\nHere is a plot of Ellen’s form (performance vs. xG) over the 12 league games that she featured in, during that season. Her biggest over performance vs. xG was when she scored in a 4-1 win away at Tottenham despite a cumulative xG of 0.597. Her worst performance by the same measure was the following week, failing to score in the 3-1 win at home to Everton. Although she only played the final \\(25\\) minutes of this game, she accrued a match xG of 0.302. The fact that these games were back to back could be tricky for a form model to accommodate!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would such a model need to do?\nEssentially, we are looking for are some numbers to help us understand the following:\n\nWhat form is a player currently in?\nHow long will a player remain in good (or bad) form?\nWhat is the uncertainty in our predictions?\n\nSince players can enter good and bad patches of form over the course of a season, we need a model that is able to twist and turn accordingly. This means we need some non-linearity.\nWe also want future predictions to be based on recent games - if a player has over performed for the last 3 games in a row, then we generally expect them to continue on this path, at least in the short-term. But how far back should we look? Does a single great performance from \\(3\\) months ago have any impact on a players current form? We need to quantify this dependency in our model too.\nFinally, a probabilistic model has the benefit of quantifying uncertainty. I emphasise the importance of this in the ‘final thoughts’ at the end of this post and for anyone interested, here is more Bayesian statistics propaganda. But, in summary we should not neglect uncertainty in this model because (a) We are not even sure what form is, and (b) we are estimating it from a small amount of indirect observations. So let’s not pretend we will end up with a single number. Enough preaching and back to the task at hand….\nOne solution that checks the above requirements is the Gaussian Process (GP).\n\n\nWhat does it look like?\nSo we have this probabilistic model of smooth, non-linear functions. Let’s see what it looks like. In the below plot, the match days are the same as those presented in the above plot, we just have a new y-axis scale, and we have ‘days’ (rather than date) along the x-axis.\nThere are multiple functions that are consistent with Ellen White’s form in the league that season, so let’s look at one example first:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere there is a large gap between successive games (such as the 3 weeks between White’s first and second appearances of the season), there is less evidence to guide predictions of form. This is also true for the period around day 60 (late December). Here though, she was on an upward trajectory. In both cases, this lack of data results in higher uncertainty, as is apparent when we look at more samples, which are shown on top of the full predictive distribution below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, so what?\nSome squiggly lines that approximately go through some points? What is the value of this when you could scribble something similar without knowing anything about statistics?\nWell, underlying all of these lines is a model of dependency. We have quantified how similar (correlated) form should be in successive games, and how this correlation will decrease with time. I will talk about the parameters that do this and how they can be interpreted in part 2 (in preparation), but to summarise, the model quantifies how correlation in form decreases as time progresses and this can be seen in the smoothness of the lines.\nFor example, if form was always shown to be very similar to that of the previous game, then transitioning from good to bad performances would be gradual, and the samples from the associated GP model would be very smooth. Conversely, in the case where performance in subsequent games were completely independent, even if very little time had passed, the GP regression lines would need to be able to change direction very sharply.\nBelow are some predictions from the model in the period just after White’s last game of the season (to the right of the final match day on the above plots). She appeared to be on a slight upward trend at this point, over performing in her final game at home to Chelsea. This is shown in the uppermost histogram. As we move away from this game, into the off-season, we see the uncertainty gradually increase in our predictions and the average move towards zero. This is consistent with the considerations discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome final thoughts…\n\nUncertainty\nAny football models we propose will only vaguely resemble the ‘true’ data generating process and though we can incrementally add more parameters we do not automatically find more evidence for them. We can build big datasets by combining observations from multiple players, and leagues, but ignoring possible variation between such data is misleading. If your big football models need big data, why stop there? Feed it some Sunday league football, or some basketball, or some handwritten digits.\nAlternatively, we acknowledge that our system of parameters are not perfectly precise, and our predictions will span credible ranges. Quantifying this variability is a strength, not a weakness of our models, and is actually of more direct use in decision support.\n\n\n\nYes we can!\n\n\n\n\nSources of Information\nWhat can we do about long periods in time where no competitive games are taking place?\nThere may be other sources of information that could help, such as performances in other competitions or even in training. Given we are not sure of the extent that these should inform the model, there is an argument to use a multi-level (partial pooling) structure, as was used to improve player-specifc xG estimates.\nFinally, the other source of information is that contained in the priors, which I have not included here. But don’t panic, some prior predictive sampling is on the way in part 2 (in preparation).\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2022,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Player {Form.} {Part} 1},\n  date = {2022-01-19},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/player_form},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2022. “Player Form.

    "title": "Bayesian Logistic Regression with Stan",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR\nLogistic regression is a popular statistical model for making predictions on outcomes between zero and one - like probabilities. One application of it in an engineering context is quantifying the effectiveness of inspection technologies at detecting damage. This post describes the additional information provided by a Bayesian application of logistic regression (and how it can be implemented using the Stan probabilistic programming language). I’ve also included some recommendations for giving your model a sensible starting point (using prior information).\n\n\n\nIntroductions\nSo there are a couple of key topics discussed here: logistic regression, and Bayesian inference. Before jumping straight into the example application, I’ve provided some very brief introductions below.\n\nBayesian Inference\nAt a very high level, Bayesian models quantify uncertainty, so that our predictions and decisions take into account the ways in which our knowledge is limited or imperfect. We specify a statistical model, and identify probabilistic estimates for the parameters. My preferred software for writing a fitting Bayesian models is Stan. If you are not yet familiar with Bayesian statistics, then I imagine you won’t be fully satisfied with that 3 sentence summary, so I will put together a separate post on the merits and challenges of applied Bayesian inference, which will include much more detail.\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nLogistic regression is used to estimate the probability of a binary outcome, such as Pass or Fail (though it can be extended for &gt; 2 outcomes). This is achieved by transforming a standard regression using the logit function, shown below. The term in the brackets may be familiar to gamblers as it is how odds are calculated from probabilities (p). You may see logit and log-odds used exchangeably for this reason.\n\\[\n\\textrm{Log odds} = \\log\\Bigg({\\frac{p}{1 - p}}\\Bigg)\n\\]\nSince the logit function transformed data from a probability scale, the inverse logit (or logistic) function transforms data to a probability scale. We can re-arrange this equation ourselves to see this:\n\\[\n\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) = \\Bigg({\\frac{p}{1 - p}}\\Bigg)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) \\times (1 - p) = p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) - p \\times \\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) = p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) = p + p \\times \\exp(\\textrm{Log odds})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}) = p (1 + \\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\exp(\\textrm{Log odds})} {1 + \\exp(\\textrm{Log odds})} = p\n\\]\nbecause multiplying by \\(\\exp(x)\\) is the same as diviving by \\(\\exp(-x)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1} {\\exp(\\textrm{-Log odds}) \\times (1 + \\exp(\\textrm{Log odds}))} = p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1} {\\exp(\\textrm{-Log odds})  + 1} = p\n\\]\nAs shown in the below plot, the values of this function range from 0 to 1.\n\\[\n\\textrm{Inverse Logit} (x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason we start with with log-odds is because we can define a linear model on this scale, with a gradient, \\(\\beta\\) and an intercept \\(\\alpha\\), and then transform it to a prediction on the probability scale, using the above steps. When a linear regression is combined with a re-scaling function such as this, it is known as a Generalised Linear Model (GLM).\n\\[\n\\textrm{Log odds} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\textrm{input variables}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-[\\alpha + \\beta \\times \\textrm{input variables}])}\n\\]\nYou may be familiar with libraries that automate the fitting of logistic regression models, either in Python (via sklearn):\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\nmodel.fit(X = dataset['input_variables'], y = dataset['predictions'])\n\n…or in R:\n\nmodel_fit &lt;- glm(formula = preditions ~ input_variables,\n                 data = dataset, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))\n\n\n\n\nExample Application: Probability of Detection\nTo demonstrate how a Bayesian logistic regression model can be fit (and utilised), I’ve included an example from one of my papers. Engineers make use of data from inspections to understand the condition of structures. Modern inspection methods, whether remote, autonomous or manual application of sensor technologies, are very good. They are generally evaluated in terms of the accuracy and reliability with which they size damage. Engineers never receive perfect information from an inspection, such as:\n\nThere is a crack of exact length 30 mm and exact depth 5 mm at this exact location, or\nThere is definitely no damage at this location.\n\nFor various reasons, the information we receive from inspections is imperfect and this is something that engineers need to deal with. As a result, providers of inspection services should be requested to provide some measure of how good their product is. This typically includes some measure of how accurately damage is sized and how reliable an outcome (detection or no detection) is.\nThis example will consider trials of an inspection tool looking for damage of varying size, to fit a model that will predict the probability of detection for any size of damage. Since various forms of damage can initiate in structures, each requiring inspection methods that are suitable, let’s avoid ambiguity and imagine we are only looking for cracks.\n\n\n\nDetecting damage: never 100% reliable\n\n\n\nTest Data\nFor the purposes of this example we will simulate some data. Let’s imagine we have introduced some cracks (of known size) into some test specimens and then arranged for some blind trials to test whether an inspection technology is able to detect them.\n\nset.seed(1008)\n\nN &lt;- 30; lower &lt;- 0; upper &lt;- 10; alpha_true &lt;- -1; beta_true &lt;- 1\n\ndepth &lt;- runif(n = N, min = lower, max = upper)\n\nPoD_1D &lt;- function(depth, alpha_1D, beta_1D){\n  PoD &lt;- exp(alpha_1D + beta_1D * log(depth)) / (1 + exp(alpha_1D + beta_1D * log(depth)))\n  return (PoD)\n}\n\npod_df &lt;- tibble(depth = depth, det = double(length = N))\n\nfor (i in seq(from = 1, to = nrow(pod_df), by = 1)) {\n  \n  pod_df$det[i] = rbernoulli(n = 1, \n                             p = PoD_1D(depth = pod_df$depth[i], \n                                       alpha_1D = alpha_true, \n                                       beta_1D = beta_true))\n  \n}\n\nThe above code is used to create 30 crack sizes (depths) between 0 and 10 mm. We then use a log-odds model to back calculate a probability of detection for each. This is based on some fixed values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). In a real trial, these would not be known, but since we are inventing the data we can see how successful our model ends up being in estimating these values.\nThe below plot shows the size of each crack, and whether or not it was detected (in our simulation). The smallest crack that was detected was 2.22 mm deep, and the largest undetected crack was 5.69 mm deep. Even so, it’s already clear that larger cracks are more likely to be detected than smaller cracks, though that’s just about all we can say at this stage.\nAfter fitting our model, we will be able to predict the probability of detection for a crack of any size.\n\n\n\n\n\nStan is a probabilistic programming language. In a future post I will explain why it has been my preferred software for statistical inference throughout my PhD.\nThe below is a simple Stan program to fit a Bayesian Probability of Detection (PoD) model:\n\nPoD_model &lt;- cmdstanr::cmdstan_model(stan_file = 'PoD_model.stan')\n\nWarning in readLines(stan_file): incomplete final line found on\n'PoD_model.stan'\n\nPoD_model$print()\n\ndata {\n\n  int &lt;lower = 0&gt; N; // Defining the number of defects in the test dataset\n  array [N] int &lt;lower = 0, upper = 1&gt; det; // A variable that describes whether each defect was detected (1) or not (0)\n  vector &lt;lower = 0&gt; [N] depth; // A variable that describes the corresponding depth of each defect\n  \n  int &lt;lower = 0&gt; K; // Defining the number of probabilistic predictions required from the model\n  vector &lt;lower = 0&gt; [K] depth_pred;\n  \n}\n\nparameters {\n  \n  // The (unobserved) model parameters that we want to recover\n  real alpha;\n  real beta;\n  \n}\n\nmodel {\n\n  // A logistic regression model relating the defect depth to whether it will be detected\n  det ~ bernoulli_logit(alpha + beta * log(depth));\n  \n  // Prior models for the unobserved parameters\n  alpha ~ normal(0, 1);\n  beta ~ normal(1, 1);\n\n}\n\ngenerated quantities {\n  \n  // Using the fitted model for probabilistic prediction.\n  // K posterior predictive distributions will be estimated for a corresponding crack depth\n  vector [K] postpred_pr;\n  \n  for (k in 1:K) {\n    \n    postpred_pr[k] = inv_logit(alpha + beta * log(depth_pred[k]));\n    \n  }\n  \n}\n\n\nThe generated quantities block will be used to make predictions for the K values of depth_pred that we provide.\n\nK &lt;- 50; depth_pred &lt;- seq(from = lower, to = upper, length.out = K)\n\nThe above code generates 50 evenly spaced values, which we will eventually combine in a plot. In some instances we may have specific values that we want to generate probabilistic predictions for, and this can be achieved in the same way.\n\n\nFitting the model\nData can be pre-processed in any language for which a Stan interface has been developed. This includes, R, Python, and Julia. In this example we will use R and the accompanying package, cmdstanr.\nOur Stan model is expecting data for three variables: N, det, depth, K and depth_pred and cmdstanr requires this in the form of a list.\n\n\nResults\nOnce we have our data, and are happy with our model, we can set off the Markov chains. There are plenty of opportunities to control the way that the Stan algorithm will run, but I won’t include that here, rather we will mostly stick with the default arguments in cmdstanr.\n\nPoD_fit &lt;- PoD_model$sample(data = list(N = N, det = pod_df$det, depth = pod_df$depth,\n                                        K = K, depth_pred = depth_pred), seed = 2408)\n\nNote:I’ve not included any detail here on the checks we need to do on our samples. There are some common challenges associated with MCMC methods, each with plenty of associated guidance on how to diagnose and resolve them. For now, let’s assume everything has gone to plan.\nNow, there are a few options for extracting samples from a stanfit object such as PoD_samples, including cmdstanr::as_draws(). However, these usually require a little post-processing to get them into a tidy format. There is a function in my DomDF R package for this, which we can use to create a tidy output that specifies the iteration, parameter value and chain associated with each data point:\n\nPoD_samples &lt;- PoD_fit |&gt; DomDF::tidy_mcmc_draws()\n\nhead(x = PoD_samples, n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  Parameter Chain Iteration value\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 lp__          1         1 -15.6\n2 lp__          1         2 -15.2\n3 lp__          1         3 -15.5\n4 lp__          1         4 -16.0\n5 lp__          1         5 -16.2\n\n\nWe have sampled from a 2-dimensional posterior distribution of the unobserved parameters in the model: \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Below is a density plot of their corresponding marginal distributions based on the 1000 samples collected from each of the 4 Markov chains that have been run.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo our estimates are beginning to converge on the values that were used to generate the data, but this plot also shows that there is still plenty of uncertainty in the results. Unlike many alternative approaches, Bayesian models account for the statistical uncertainty associated with our limited dataset - remember that we are estimating these values from 30 trials. These results describe the possible values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in our model that are consistent with the limited available evidence. If more data was available, we could expect the uncertainty in our results to decrease. I think there are some great reasons to keep track of this statistical (sometimes called epistemic) uncertainty - a primary example being that we should be interested in how confident our predictive models are in their own results! …but I’ll leave it at that for now, and try to stay on topic.\nHow do we know what do these estimates of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) mean for the PoD (what we are ultimately interested in)? We can check this using the posterior predictive distributions that we have (thanks to the generated quantities block of the Stan program).\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to note from these results is that the model is able to make much more confident predictions for larger crack sizes. The increased uncertainty associated with shallow cracks reflects the lack of data available in this region - this could be useful information for a decision maker!\nThere are only 3 trials in our dataset considering cracks shallower than 3 mm (and only 1 for crack depths &lt; 2 mm). If we needed to make predictions for shallow cracks, this analysis could be extended to quantify the value of future tests in this region.\n\n\nFinal Thought: Where Did Those Priors Come From and Are They Any Good?\nThere are many approaches for specifying prior models in Bayesian statistics. Weakly informative and MaxEnt priors are advocated by various authors. Unfortunately, Flat Priors are sometimes proposed too, particularly (but not exclusively) in older books. A flat prior is a wide distribution - in the extreme this would be a uniform distribution across all real numbers, but in practice distribution functions with very large variance parameters are sometimes used. In either case, a very large range prior of credible outcomes for our parameters is introduced the model. This may sound innocent enough, and in many cases could be harmless.\nFlat priors have the appeal of describing a state of complete uncertainty, which we may believe we are in before seeing any data - but is this really the case?\n\n\n\nPrior Expectations: Can We Do Better?\n\n\nSuppose you are using Bayesian methods to model the speed of some athletes. Even before seeing any data, there is some information that we can build into the model. For instance, we can discount negative speeds. We also wouldn’t need to know anything about the athletes to know that they would not be travelling faster than the speed of light. This may sound facetious, but flat priors are implying that we should treat all outcomes as equally likely. In fact, there are some cases where flat priors cause models to require large amounts of data to make good predictions (meaning we are failing to take advantage of Bayesian statistics ability to work with limited data).\nIn this example, we would probably just want to constrain outcomes to the range of metres per second, but the amount of information we choose to include is ultimately a modelling choice. Another helpful feature of Bayesian models is that the priors are part of the model, and so must be made explicit - fully visible and ready to be scrutinised.\nA common challenge, which was evident in the above PoD example, is lacking an intuitive understanding of the meaning of our model parameters. Here \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) required prior models, but I don’t think there is an obvious way to relate their values to the result we were interested in. They are linear regression parameters on a log-odds scale, but this is then transformed into a probability scale using the logit function.\nThis problem can be addressed using a process known as Prior Predictive Simulation, which I was first introduced to in Richard McElreath’s fantastic book. This involves evaluating the predictions that our model would make, based only on the information in our priors. Relating our predictions to our parameters provides a clearer understanding of the implications of our priors.\nBack to our PoD parameters - both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) can take positive or negative values, but I could not immediately tell you a sensible range for them. Based on our lack of intuition it may be tempting to use a variance for both, right? Well, before making that decision, we can always simulate some predictions from these priors. The below code is creating a data frame of prior predictions for the PoD (PoD_pr) for many possible crack sizes.\n(Thank you to Jiun for your kind message that helped me tidy up the below)\n\\[\n\\alpha \\sim N(\\mu_{\\alpha}, \\sigma_{\\alpha})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta \\sim N(\\mu_{\\beta}, \\sigma_{\\beta})\n\\]\nAnd we can visualise the information contained within our priors for a couple of different cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur wide, supposedly non-informative priors result in some pretty useless predictions. I’ve suggested some more sensible priors that suggest that larger cracks are more likely to be detected than small cracks, without overly constraining our outcome (see that there is still prior credible that very small cracks are detected reliably and that very large cracks are often missed).\nWhy did our predictions end up looking like this?\nBorrowing from McElreath’s explanation, it’s because \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are linear regression parameters on a log-odds (logit) scale. Since we are estimating a PoD we end up transforming out predictions onto a probability scale. Flat priors for our parameters imply that extreme values of log-odds are credible. All that prior credibility of values &lt; - 3 and &gt; 3 ends up getting concentrated at probabilities near 0 and 1. I think this is a really good example of flat priors containing a lot more information than they appear to.\nI’ll end by directing you towards some additional (generally non-technical) discussion of choosing priors, written by the Stan development team (link). It provides a definition of weakly informative priors, some words of warning against flat priors and more general detail than this humble footnote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2020,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Bayesian {Logistic} {Regression} with {Stan}},\n  date = {2020-02-15},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/Logistic_Bayes},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2020. “Bayesian Logistic Regression with\nStan.” February 15, 2020. https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/Logistic_Bayes."

    "text": "TLDR\nFor many of you reading this, developing and testing predictive models is a lot of fun - but my pragmatic, buzz-killing message here, is that we shouldn’t forget why we ever asked to do it. I suggest that the reason is (almost?) always, to help support decision-making. And yet, we often have this unhelpful disconnect between a calculation, and what the results imply for how we should act. An analyst hands over their work to a manager or budget holder, who then reinterprets everything and makes a call, which may or may not be consistent with the information they have been provided - sound familiar? It does to me.\nIn this post (Part 1) these two domains are considered jointly, using an example. We see how this can allow for practioners to arrive at coherent and reproducible (auditable) decisions. Part 2 will consider a specific application of this approach, known as value of information analysis.\n\n\n\nA Familiar Scenario\nWhen I worked as an engineer I would often be asked to perform calculations (using spreadsheets 🙃 ) to arrive at some number regarding a safe operating condition for a damaged structure.\nModels for the sake of themselves can be plenty of fun, but unless they are tied to the underlying decsions that they are supposed to inform, they are not necessarily fulfilling their purpose.\n\n\n\nSo You’ve Fit a Predictive Model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  d1[Decision] --&gt; o1((Uncertain \\noutcome))\n  d1 --&gt; c1{Utility}\n  o1 --&gt; c1\n\n\n\nExample Influence Diagram with Decisions (square nodes), Uncertain Outcomes (circles) and Utility (diamonds).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis &gt; Vibes!\nThese (decision/influence/whatever!) diagrams provide a clear map of what factors we think we need to consider when making a decision. They also provide causal information, showing how intervening at one point can have downstream effects. They may seem trivial, but once you try and draw one for a problem you are working on, you will see they encourage you to think deeply about your area of expertise - no seriously, please try it!\nTheir apparent simplicity also has the benefit of being able to communicate qualitative information with various stakeholders. An experienced engineer could map out complex relationships between variables so that a statistical model could be developed that was consistent with this information. This could then be used to inform decisions.\nBut, is any of this ever required? If the goal is to arrive at a decision that aligns with subject matter knowledge, then can’t we just ask the expert to jump right to the decision?\nThis will not always be a valid shortcut. If you have attended workshops that were organised to get a room of experts to agree on a strategy, there will not always be a clear agreement. This is not necessarily because of a lack of expertise, but because of a lack of a common language to communicate the information. Formalising the structure of the problem, the prior knowledge, and where data should be used to update parameters results in a quantitive, reproducible and (with a little extra work) explanaible decision-making process.\n\n\nBuying a car\nI do not know much about cars, despite being mistake for a mechanic based on my interest in engineering. In fact, when buying my first car, I noticed that a button on the key was not unlocking the door and so suggested to the garage that they may need to reduce the price. A confused salesman showed me the other side of the key, where a small light was flashing, “it’s a torch, mate. For when you need to unlock your car in the dark.” I lost all bargaining power.\nI was reluctant to overpay, and could perhaps have looked at some data to help inform me. Here is an example dataset on car prices from Kaggle. We’re using my new favourite language for scientific computing, Julia, today. FYI, it’s a dream. I’ll perhaps write about why I love it another time, but here is the homepage.\nLet’s start by loading the libraries that we’ll need.\n\n# For reading and handling the data\nusing CSV, DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\n# For working with probabilistic models\nusing Distributions, Random, Stan\n\nA simple example - perhaps you will develop some intuition for the problem as you read it, but hopefully I have convinced you that it will sometimes be worthwhile to draw it out and do the maths. Think of the early decision-theorist Howard Raiffa famously drew a decision tree to help him decide which academic position to take up, as he documented in this paper.\n\nMersenneTwister(231123) |&gt;\n  prng -&gt; rand(prng, Normal(0, 1), 10)\n\n10-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.4797047482429591\n  0.3492046160452603\n  1.9035942889710349\n -1.0599399228488406\n -0.05026230935484321\n  1.6159635845804887\n  0.46192798081799236\n  0.38816396593759556\n -1.4500821161955104\n -0.3667444519178413\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n\n\n\nMight your decisions impact the safety of the public?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{di francesco2024,\n  author = {Di Francesco, Domenic},\n  title = {Decisions Under {Uncertainty.} {Part} 1},\n  date = {2024-02-01},\n  url = {https://www.allyourbayes.com//posts/BDA_pt1},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDi Francesco, Domenic. 2024. “Decisions Under Uncertainty.
