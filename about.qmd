I'm Dom Di Francesco, a researcher in digital twins and data-centric engineering at the Alan Turing Institute and a member of the CSML group at Cambridge University (Civil Engineering). 

My research interests include Bayesian statistics and itâ€™s applications to decision support, such as quantification of the expected value of data collection. 

I also work in football (soccer) analytics.
