I'm Dom Di Francesco, a Turing Research Fellow, working in digital twins, data-centric engineering and AI assurance at the Alan Turing Institute. I am also a member of the CSML group at Cambridge University (Civil Engineering).

My research interests include Bayesian statistics and itâ€™s applications to decision support, such as quantification of the expected value of data collection. 

I also work in football (soccer) analytics.
