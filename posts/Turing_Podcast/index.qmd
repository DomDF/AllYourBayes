### TLDR

Last year, I participated in an episode of the Alan Turing Institute's Coffee Pod podcast. It was hosted by my friend [Bea](https://twitter.com/mooniean) and we talked about my background in engineering, my PhD and transition into computational statistics and machine learning, my interest in football, and my (then) new puppy Ada - looking skeptical in the thumbnail :dog:. 

Here's the episode, I hope you enjoy it!
