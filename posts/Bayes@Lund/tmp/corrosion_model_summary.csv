# Inference for Stan model: corrosion_model_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.19, 0.20, 0.18, 0.19) seconds, 0.76 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.24, 0.25, 0.23, 0.25) seconds, 0.98 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
