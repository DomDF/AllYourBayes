### TLDR

At a previous job, my colleagues and I would occasionally create football (soccer) quizzes for each other. The game I used to send them would involve me sequentially sending a list of (increasingly helpful) clues, from which they had to guess which player I was thinking of. I have now turned this into a web app using the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) and [shinyjs](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) `R` libraries, and you can play it here. You can find the code on the GitHub link that I have included in the app. 

I hope you enjoy it!

Edit: I will try and update this regularly with new players & clues, so keep checking back. Suggestions are welcome - you can [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Domenic_DF).
